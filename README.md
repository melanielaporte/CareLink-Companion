# UX Research Case Study

## Project Overview
The GlucoTrack Dashboard was designed to help individuals with diabetes visualize and act on their glucose data. The goal was to simplify health monitoring through a user-centered, intuitive design that could cater to a wide demographic of users, including those with varying levels of tech literacy.

## Research Objective
To explore the unique challenges faced by caregivers and identify app features that streamline care management while supporting self-care.

## Research Process
1. Empathy Mapping
- Conducted sessions with 15 caregivers to understand their daily routines, challenges, and emotional states.
- Observational Insights: Caregivers often feel overwhelmed by balancing care tasks and their own health.
2. Field Observations
- Shadowed caregivers in their routines to identify inefficiencies in communication and task tracking.
- Insight: Many relied on paper lists or basic apps that lacked comprehensive features.
3. Persona Development
- Created personas representing caregivers with varying levels of tech familiarity and caregiving responsibilities.
- Focused on making the app intuitive for tech-novice users.
4. Usability Testing
- Tested app prototypes with 10 caregivers across different demographics.
- Feedback: Users wanted quick access to glucose monitoring data and reminders for critical tasks.

## Design Solutions
- Shared dashboards -> Enabled real-time glucose data sharing between patients and caregivers.
- Task management -> Introduced customizable task reminders with alerts for overdue items.
- Self-Care tools -> Designed a dedicated section for mindfulness exercises, educational resources, and peer support.

## Results
- 75% of caregivers reported reduced stress after using the app for a week.
- 80% said the app improved communication and care coordination with their patients.
